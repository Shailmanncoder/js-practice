    let story_1=`In a peaceful forest, there lived a small owl named Ollie. Unlike the other animals, Ollie was always quiet and observant. One day, the animals argued over who was the smartest: the clever fox, the strong bear, or the swift deer.

The wise old tortoise suggested, “Let’s ask Ollie. He watches everything.”

Ollie hooted softly and said, “The smartest is the one who uses their skills to help others.”

The fox helped the rabbit find food, the bear built a safe den for the hedgehog, and the deer guided the lost squirrel back to its family. The animals realised Ollie was right – true wisdom comes from kindness and teamwork.`

let story_2=`Max was a young boy who loved to draw and his drawings were admired by everyone in his small village. One day while exploring the bustling market he stumbled upon a tiny shop filled with dusty old items and among them he found a peculiar paintbrush that seemed to shimmer faintly in the sunlight. Feeling an unexplainable pull toward it Max decided to buy it and took it home.

That evening he began painting with his new brush and as he painted an apple on a blank canvas he watched in awe as the apple slowly came to life and became real. Max could hardly believe his eyes but he realized the paintbrush was magical and could turn his creations into reality. With excitement he painted toys for his friends and delicious meals for those who were hungry and soon word spread through the village about the boy with the extraordinary paintbrush.

One day a greedy man heard about Max and his magic brush. This man was rich and powerful and he demanded that Max paint him a magnificent palace filled with gold and treasures beyond imagination. Max hesitated because he did not trust the man but he agreed because he did not want trouble. Using his clever mind Max painted the palace so enormous and so intricate that the greedy man became lost inside it unable to find his way out.

After that day Max decided to use the brush only for good and he dedicated himself to helping those in need by creating what they lacked and bringing joy to the lives of others. The villagers adored Max for his generosity and kindness and he learned that the true magic of the paintbrush was not in its power but in how it could be used to make the world a better place.`
let story_3=`Cleo was a tiny caterpillar who lived in a lush green meadow filled with wildflowers that swayed gently in the warm breeze. From the moment Cleo hatched from her little egg she was filled with an endless sense of wonder. Every day she explored the world around her inching along leaves and twigs and asking questions about everything she saw.

Why is the sky blue she wondered aloud as she looked up at the vast expanse above her. Why do the birds have wings and why can they fly high above the trees. Why do flowers bloom and how do they get their beautiful colors. Her questions never seemed to stop but no one around her had all the answers.

One day as Cleo was munching on a delicious green leaf she saw a sparrow land on a nearby branch. The sparrow was vibrant with feathers that shimmered in shades of brown and gold. Cleo crawled closer and asked the sparrow why can you fly and I cannot.

The sparrow chirped and tilted its head you will fly one day too little one but you must be patient.

Cleo was puzzled and she wriggled her tiny body I do not think so I have no wings like you. How could I ever fly.

The sparrow smiled in a knowing way and said some things take time and you must trust the process. With that the sparrow flapped its wings and soared into the sky leaving Cleo to wonder even more about what the sparrow meant.

As days turned into weeks Cleo noticed her body changing. She grew tired more often and one day she felt an urge to find a safe spot. She climbed to a sturdy branch and spun herself into a silky cocoon wrapping herself up tightly until she was completely hidden from the outside world.

Inside the cocoon Cleo felt as if time had stopped. She slept deeply dreaming of the sky and of flying through the clouds like the sparrow she had met. She could not explain it but she felt something magical happening.

Finally one sunny morning Cleo woke up and felt different. She pushed her way out of the cocoon and the sunlight warmed her new body. She looked down and gasped in amazement. Her tiny caterpillar body was gone and in its place were beautiful wings painted with vibrant colors of orange and black. She had transformed into a butterfly.

Cleo flapped her wings uncertainly at first and then with growing confidence. Before she knew it she was soaring above the meadow feeling the wind carry her higher and higher. She gazed at the flowers and trees below and laughed with pure joy.

As she flew she remembered the words of the sparrow and realized that sometimes the answers to life’s biggest questions come with time and patience. She had always wondered what it would be like to fly and now she understood that some dreams come true when you least expect them.

And from that day forward Cleo the butterfly soared through the skies spreading joy and inspiration to everyone she met reminding them that change is part of life’s greatest adventure.
